[FREE] SYBYR  SYRINGE x ERIC NORTH TYPE BEAT - WEIRD ASL  (prod. by underBWE)

why can't you die
problems i despise
truthful wrapped 
in morbid lies
morbid lies i 
testify to these moments
fullest in angst 
diversify for donners
angst so bright i 
feel day-capped, 
shining 
captured light to these moments
promise promise

you'll never wake up alive

treating to bring them down
array of lies, 

-dish out, pull up 
- crib is exposed, 
 - routing actives, run protocol, collect the darkness
make it into a symbol of a new world
village run by few

burn the proof, activate the facets
