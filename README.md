thoughts
why can't you die
problems i despise
truthful wrapped 
in morbid lies
morbid lies i 
testify to these moments
fullest in angst 
diversify in horrors
angst so bright i (angst repetition change)
feel day-capped, 

shining 
captured light to these moments
promise promise

you'll never wake up alive

treating to bring them
down
treating to bring them
down
array of lies, 

-dish out, flip sides
pull up 
- crib so exposed, 

 - run protocol routing actives (on routine basis - alternative later on)
collective darkness
make it into a symbol of a world anew

village run by few who can't stand it

burn the proof, activating faces (activating phases)

reverb
my fucking
fault yeah

my fucking
fault yeah

they tried to bury me (deep)
but didn't realize i was a seed
the more depth to traverse 
the stronger the resolve
